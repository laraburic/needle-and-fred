### We are a team of 5 people that met in a game dev community. We decided to try to create a game together using Unity for [Jame Gam #40](https://itch.io/jam/jame-gam-40) and this is the result!  
****UPDATE 29/5/24**: The ratings have come in and our game has finished **#16 out of 101** submissions! Full results page can be found [here](https://itch.io/jam/jame-gam-40/rate/2729478).
